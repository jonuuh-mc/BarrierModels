## BarrierModels

Uses mixins to create and render barrier block models.

/barriers render - toggle rendering  
/barriers connect - toggle connected textures  
/barriers particle - toggle creative mode held item particles

\
custom textures can be made with: https://jonuuh-mc.github.io/BarrierModels/  
^ will create an overlay pack given any 16x16 texture  
(uses a pixel at x,y coords given by the two sliders to replace 1 layer of pixels along texture sides or corners)  
(made this tool in a few hours, definitely full of bugs)

\
limitations:  
 * unintended behaviors (black bars on some texture faces when adjacent to barriers) in combination with optifine connected textures, haven't yet put in the time to find the exact cause
