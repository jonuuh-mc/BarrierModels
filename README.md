### Commands:  
/barriers render - toggle rendering  
/barriers connect - toggle connected textures  
/barriers particle - toggle creative mode held item particles

### Custom textures
https://jonuuh-mc.github.io/BarrierModels/  
This tool will create an overlay pack specifically for this mod given any 16x16 texture  
(uses a pixel at x,y coords given by the two sliders to replace 1 layer of pixels along texture sides or corners)  
(made this tool in a few hours, definitely full of bugs)

### Limitations 
 * Still has unintended behaviors (black bars on some texture faces when adjacent to barriers) in combination with optifine connected textures, haven't yet put in the time to find the exact cause
